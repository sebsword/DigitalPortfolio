        <h1>More info - Deputy Head Boy</h1>
        <p>It was nearing the end of year 10 when the prefect enrolement was re-opened to accomidate for our year group who would shortly replace the current year 11s and become the eldest in the school. The roles and responsibilities were made clear to us to ensure that only the best amongst us consider applying. Initially we had to fill in a form in the style of a personal statement, the best applications were then forwarded to the interview process with our principal and the head of a partnered school. </p>
     	<p>Those of us who were succesful in the interview process were chosen to be prefects, unbeknown to us the process had also been used to select the potential Head Boy, despite not specifying interest in this role me and five other students were shortlisted for it and given a day to prepare a speach (to the entire school) about why we would be the best candidate this years head boy.</p>
        <h2>My Speech</h2>
        <p>"A lot of you in this room may be wondering who I am, some of you may have seen me around the school before but for the majority of you this is your first time meeting me, While some of my peers may have seen this as a disadvantage I would say the opposite, all it means is that Your opinions on me will be based solely on what I say and to Right Now. So to the Important Question, Why should I be head boy?
Well I have always prided myself as a hard working and trustworthy individual,I do my utmost best to ensure that I seize any and all opportunities and I generally tend to exceed any expectations set upon me. Not only am I a good listener, but I am able to take others thoughts into consideration, a quality that If I do get head boy will help me to tailor our school to your specific needs.
Many people see Head Boy as a position of great power, But I want challenge that, How can you show me respect if I'm demanding it, I understand that being Head Boy isn't about being better than anyone, or trying to catch people out. It's about working with you to improve our school, and encouraging you to do your best so that your time here is spent wisely
One of a Head Boys' most important roles is to represent their school. Now while I can't be an embodiment of all of you, I do feel that my qualities are a generalisation of our school ethos. I would also like to make the link between students and the school council stronger, to ensure that any issues raised are not only debated about but actually solved.
Remember Voting for me is voting for confidence, Improvements and overall better future for our school, thank you for listening this has been Sébastien Allen."</p>

        <h2>The Decision</h2>
        <p>After hearing our speaches the students at our school were given a (single transferable) vote to choose the 'Head' and 'Deputy Head' boys.</p>
        <img src="../Images/Achievements/Deputy_Pics/vote.png">
        <p>Although important, the student vote wasn't the only deciding factor, the majority of teachers were similarly given a vote to select the best candidate. From these votes I secured the positon of Deputy Head Boy, lead by Chiyinde Lewis (Head Boy) </p>
        <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul class="indentless">
        	<li>Guide a team of senior prefects</li>
        	<li>Oversee the work of all prefects</li>
        	<li>Be an aproachable figure and a good representative of the school</li>
        	<li>Attend all open evenings to assist teachers in their duty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Despite only aiming to be a prefect I ended up becoming the deputy head boy, this process taught me to never underestimate myself.</p>
