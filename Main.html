        <h1>Welcome to my Digital Portfolio</h1>
        <p>The following pages are designed to give you a brief overview of my life within my short time at Henry Compton/Fullham College Boys' School. The motto of our school has alsways been to embrace opportunity, and this portfolio will demonstrate to you how I have upheld this expectation throughout my time at school, from my Youth Parliament campaign to my ICT Coursework files, the highlights of my 4 years and my biggest achievements are all here for you to see.</p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>As well as serving my memory,this portfolio was designed as an alternative to a CV/Covering letter that could be flexibly applied to any application process, as such I will continue to update it when necissary in the future. Any prospective Employer/Admissions officer that would like to offer me a place at your institution, feel free to contact me using the updated Information that I have provided. As of now myself and the rest of year 11 around the country are in the midst of a very time consuming and heated exam season, regardless of this I will try to respond to any messages in a timely manner, but do keep in mind I will also have to prioritise my studdies and my examinations.</p>
