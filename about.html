        <h2 class="abt_h2">Background Info</h2>
        <img src="Images/about_me/seb_web.png" class="abt_img">
        <p>Born in the year 1998, I was always considered a fast learner, my brother who was no-more than a year older than me served as my inspiration and ensured that I was always one year ahead of my peers accademically. I studdied at St.Francis of Assisi Primary School between the years 2002 - 2008 and then transitioned to Henry Compton (soon to be FCBS) to continue my education. It was only around year 7 ( my first year in secondary school ) that I began to develop my interest for the sciences that defined me as a person. I am currently searching for a sixth-form to attend for years 12 and 13.</p>

        <p>As well as cycling I also began learning to box in 2014 . I took part in weekly sessions for 3 months before becoming eledgible for my first boxing certificate, Outside of sport, I am a skilled gamer who has recently surfaced on the competitive scene of the 'League of Legends', any extra time is spent  learning the various coding lanuguages.  </p>
