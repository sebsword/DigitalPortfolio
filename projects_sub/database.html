     <h2>Tables</h2>
     <img src="../Images/Projects/Database_Pics/Patient Table.png">
     <p>This is a small sample of the altogether 50 records contained within my patient table, the patient table you see before consisted of many fields, all relevant to the scenario, such as Patient ID, Gender etc, because I was building a relational database this, hoverer, wasn't the only table in the project, instead, there were two others (three in total) the patient table that you see, a separate doctors table and the appointments table that formed the relationship tying the other tables together.</p>
     </div>
     
     <div id="dtb_box2" class="dtb_box">
     <h2>Main Menu</h2>
     <img src="../Images/Projects/Database_Pics/mainmenu.png">
     <p>This was the main menu for my database, from this screen each and every function I created could be accessed and performed, I also created several sub menus  that were consistent with the design of the main menu. One such form allowed users to access the different types of forms, another let them view the major reports, there was also the option to view the 'queries switchboard' an independent menu (with similar design) that allowed users to run the various queries.</p>
     </div>
     
     <div id="dtb_box3" class="dtb_box">
     <h2>Forms</h2>
     <img src="../Images/Projects/Database_Pics/Patient Form.png">
     <p>This is an example of one of the three tabular forms that I created for the database, It organised the fields and lables across several pages so that each field was not only easier to locate but easier to look at (Design) There were also two other forms not shown here, one for each table, these were the Doctors form that allowed users to update add new information on doctors and the appointments form that did the same thing for the many appointments in the database. </p>

        <h2>Scenario</h2>
        <p> For this unit we were tasked with creating a database that would the increase efficiency of an appointment system for a doctors surgery. </p>
        <img src="../Images/Projects/Database_Pics/mylogodoc3.png">
        <p> There was a pre-defined list of user requirements that we had to follow in order to be successful, we also had to ensure that the design and functionality of the databases we were creating would be suitable for a doctors surgery and its staff as we had to justify every decision.</p>
        
        <h2>User Requirements</h2>
        <ul class="indentless">
        	<li>Two different styled data entry sub-forms</li>
        	<li>At least two tables (linked together by a relationship)</li>
        	<li>Validation to reduce the risk of errors</li>
        	<li>Ability to store data on 5 doctors</li>
            <li>An easy to use input/output screen</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The validation was one of the trickier aspects of the task it required an extensive knowledge of code and the Microsoft access validation rules (all of which were also useful in the creation of this website).Creating the relationship between the three tables was also difficult, it was solved by using foreign/key fields to link the tables together.</p>
