        <h1>Unit 1: The Online World</h1>
        <p>The Unit 1 online world exam is the very first unit we attempted for our ICT BTEC, unlike the other units we attempted the online world was the only one typically considered as 'core' most entrants to the course will complete it at one point or another, the unit was also the only externally assessed exam we completed and for many of us it was our first try at doing a computer based examination. Although repeats were available the exam was still difficult and grades usually improve marginally.</p>
        <h2>The Exam</h2>
        <iframe width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DnoGR2UQl-Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Displayed above is a walkthrough videos I created for the unit 1 online world exam, although it was not requested for the course it was a very useful material in ensuring I and countless others hit the pass mark. Collectively the members of my school attempted the BTEC exam on 3 seperate occasions, although the difficulty did vary with each attempt they were all consistantly harder than the practise/sample assessment shown above, Despite this can proudly report that I was the only person in my class who achieved a level 2 pass grade ( or higher ) on either of the 3 attempts which puts me on a good path for achieving my overall target grade of a Distinction or a Distinction*.</p>

        <h2>Assessed Content</h2>
        <p>The Unit 1 Online World exam was definately the most challenging of all the units on the BTEC course because of the range of topics it covered.</p>
        <img src="../Images/Projects/Online_Pics/ow_globe.png.png">
        <p> The exam is one hour long and contains a total of 50 individual marks, to discourage cheating each entrant has a slightly different exam to their peer the difficulty is intended to be the same however we have seen that this is not always possible.</p>
        <h2>Main Topics</h2>
        <ul class="indentless">
        	<li>Types of online services </li>
        	<li>Backbone of the internet &  the different media for transporting data</li>
        	<li>Internet Protocols & Communication</li>
        	<li>How to stay safe online (privacy issues and other threats)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although some of the content taught in the course is challenging, some areas are easy and most of the knowledge is both relevant and useful in life.</p>
